# Time-Series-Analysis
Using three variables, i.e., the growth of Chinese GDP, CPI and MI, to estimate and forecast the size of Chinese shadow banking 
by a time series model. Then according to the estimation, I built a VAR model and carry out a impulse response analysis (IRA). 
Through the IRA, I got the result of the mutual impact effect of the size of shadow banking, the growth of GDP, the growth of CPI,
and the growth of MI.
